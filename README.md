  <h1>CrossGate Library & Forum Site</h1>
</div>

## About?
resurrected unfinished project used as part of the CrossGate desktop app API & utility

## Finished & Still Missing Feature
[Here is the list](https://github.com/Qwidio/crossgate-web-utility/ohmygodthelistgoeson.md) of the site feature & pages that is still not yet made/finished and I'll update this list for every major change.

## running on your own machine
in your local machine it is recommended for you to have these in your enviroment:
- PHP 8+ installed
- compatible MySQL instalation 

I'm using XAMPP 8.2.12 because those already installed along with it,
to check if the site are working open up this link `localhost/thePathNameYouExtractThisProjectOn/index.php` on your browser
