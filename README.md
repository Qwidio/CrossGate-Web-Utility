  <h1>CrossGate Library & Forum Site</h1>
</div>

## About?
resurrected unfinished project used as part of the CrossGate desktop app API & utility

## Missing Feature
Here is the list of the site feature & pages that is still not yet made/finished and I'll update this list every change:
- Auth API
- Mark software to user MarkOut
- software lister and search software feature
- category page
- universal view page
- groups page
- group management
- software publishing
- software management
- forum dashboard
- forum topic page
- full documentation

## running on your own machine
in your local machine it is recommended for you to have these in your enviroment:
- PHP 8+ installed
- compatible MySQL instalation 

I'm using XAMPP 8.2.12 because those already installed along with it,
to check if the site are working open up this link `localhost/thePathNameYouExtractThisProjectOn/index.php` on your browser
